# your_expenses_app
:white_check_mark: This application was made for educational purposes while studying react in Udemy. Bellow you can find some features of the app!

  - A simple way to add the name, price and date of purchase of a specific product.
  - A log like display of the products purchased with all the previous details depending on the year.
  - A graphical display of how you distributed your money each month for each year dynamically

:sparkles: Some nice ideas and possible future updates of this app!

  - Add a remove-edit feature of an expense.
  - Upgrade and connect to a small database.
  - Implement dynamic personalised decoration options.

:hammer_and_wrench: This project was made using the following:

  - VS Code
  - html
  - css
  - React

:warning: Caution, once you download the app you need to run in your Visual Studio Code terminal the following commands:

  - npm install (in order to install various app dependancies)
  - npm start (in order to get the app running)

Special thanks to mr Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller and his react course!
